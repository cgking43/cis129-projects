print('One stormy night, Alyssa was enjoying a book on the couch under the warm enbrame of candlelight. When suddenly there was a knocking on the door.
print("""'Why could that be? It's late and its raining.' Alyssa thought, but got up to check the door anyway.""")
print('As Alyssa made her way to the front door, the world around her was silent. As she reached for the doorknob she heard a creak and a slow loud knock coming from the closet door on the other end of the room. Alyssa froze, but then began to turn towards the noise, her candle went out.') 
print('All that was left was her in the complete darkness and whatever came to disturb her peace that night')
